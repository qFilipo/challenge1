          <p>Is Frontend Mentor free?</p>
          <span><img class="plus" src="assets/images/icon-plus.svg"/></span>
        </div>
        <p>The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. 
          It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.</p>

        <p>Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your portfolio.
           Helping developers add professional-looking projects to their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!</p>

        </div>
        <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server.
           There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions.
           We even have a dedicated "help" channel!
           If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Discord server here.</p>
